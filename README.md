You can use `start` to startup the app. This will run unit tests, start the build process, and start the server

```
  yarn start

Go on localhost:3000 and play around with it


### Things to Note
1. There's validation for the inputs, so if you don't fill it out then the submit button will be disabled
2. I could have done this without Redux. Also thought it was a good to show
3. Also the email field in the edit and add fields must be a valid email also.
4. phone numbers removed are set to inactive
